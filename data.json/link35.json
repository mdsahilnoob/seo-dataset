JavaScript is a very flexible and versatile programming language, considered as a core technology for web development. This is because it is the only language natively supported by all browsers, allowing developers to add dynamic behavior and create complex user experiences with this language. Because of its flexibility and portability, JavaScript is also widely used for back-end development (thanks to runtimes such as Node.js, Bun, and Deno) and even server-side scripting (for automation and for creating developer tools). What does a JavaScript developer do? A JavaScript developer writes and maintains code to build interactive web applications, back-end logic (usually RESTful APIs), or some automation work. If they're focused on front-end development, their work usually involves designing dynamic user interfaces and integrating them with REST APIs (usually) to connect with back-end systems. If, on the other hand, they're focused on back-end development, then most likely, they're spending most of their time developing APIs using a back-end framework like NestJS. Frequently Asked Questions What skills does a JavaScript developer need? A JavaScript developer needs to have a solid grasp of core JavaScript concepts to be successful because those will be the only common concepts that any framework or library they might depend on will use. These core concepts include functions, operators, and data structures. And they should include experience with at least one JavaScript framework or core library, such as React for building interactive websites or NextJS for backends. If their focus is back-end development, concepts such as API design and integration, data modeling, server-side rendering, and database querying are a must, as these will be part of the developer's daily tasks. Front-end developers should also learn about web standards, the DOM API, web components (or lightning web components if you're working with the Salesforce ecosystem), and have some basic understanding of UX. Candidates looking to prepare for a JavaScript career should include the above-mentioned topics in their study program. For that, many developers schedule their studies at their own pace through extensive documentation, online training, and roadmaps like this one to build a solid foundational knowledge base. Once they have mastered the basics of JavaScript and are ready for an entry-level role, they should prepare for the application process, including JavaScript interview questions and JavaScript coding interview questions.
